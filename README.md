# RedditDAWM

Reddit API made in ASP.NET Core 6. Even though there are more entities than the user, you can't do anything with them.
You can get users, get a single user, add users, edit usernames and delete a specific user (not like you need anything else).

There is no authentication, database, or something. Just a simple API that returns made up data.
